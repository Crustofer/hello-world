# hello-world
the program displays hello world.
So, I'm a 16 year old high school student named .............., and I;ve been interested in programing since 2015, but after some failed attempts I gave up on it because I couldn't understand it only to be interested in programing after two long years, and at the moment, I'm looking for new and interesting ways to learn programing such as github. :3
